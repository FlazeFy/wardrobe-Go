# üëï WARDROBE

> **Wardrobe Web** is a **web-based clothing management** application that helps users organize their **daily wardrobe**, **automate outfit selection**, and **schedule laundry routines**. Users can input **detailed data** for each clothing item such as name, type, brand, material, size, and price and track when each piece is worn. The system also allows users to set reminders, enabling **automatic notifications** when an outfit is scheduled to be used the next day. The platform integrates with **Wardrobe Mobile**, **Wardrobe Telegram Bot**, **Wardrobe Line Bot**, and **Wardrobe Desktop**, offering a cross-platform experience through a **single account**. Users can manage and view their wardrobe, schedules, and laundry history across devices. Data export features in **PDF** and **Excel** formats are also available for greater flexibility in wardrobe management. While the application is accessible on both desktop and mobile browsers, administrative access is reserved for the **Wardrobe Desktop Admin** on desktop devices.

> This repository is the **backend codebase** for the **next backend version** of the Wardrobe app, built using **Golang** with the **Gin framework**. The **primary backend** of the application is still powered by **Laravel** and can be accessed at:

## üéØ Product Overview
- **Clothing & Outfit Data Management**
Users can manage their clothing data within the Wardrobe application. The data recorded may include clothing name, type, brand, price, material, and size.

- **Scheduling & History**
From the saved clothing data, users can log each time a clothing item or outfit is used, and set reminder schedules. The system will then notify users whenever an outfit is scheduled to be used the next day.

- **Laundry Management**
Users can also track the laundry process of clothes after being worn, up to the status where the clothing is ready to be used again.

- **Automatic Outfit Suggestion**
Based on the clothing data, the system can generate various outfit combinations and recommend an outfit for the next day. This is determined by usage history, availability status, weather conditions, and user preferences.

- **Data Export**
The application provides convenience for users who want to view complete datasets of clothing, usage history, or laundry history. Export to PDF and Excel formats is available to support more customized wardrobe management.

## üöÄ Target Users

1. **Everyday People**
Individuals who want to efficiently manage their daily clothing collections, track outfit usage, schedule laundry, and receive outfit suggestions.

2. **Laundry Service Customers**
Users who frequently use laundry services and need to monitor the washing and return status of their clothes.

## üß† Problem to Solve

1. People often **forget what clothes they own**, where they are, or when they last wore or washed them leading to **inefficient usage** and cluttered wardrobes.
2. Planning daily outfits manually is **time-consuming** and can lead to repeated usage, poor combinations, or unprepared clothing.
3. Users **forget to wash** or **retrieve laundry** in time, leaving them without clean clothes when needed.
4.  **Manually recording** outfit usage, laundry status, or purchase details becomes overwhelming.
5. **Exporting wardrobe data** for budgeting, or personal reference is **difficult** without a structured digital system.

## üí° Solution

1. Offer a feature for users to digitally log and **manage clothing** items with details like name, size, brand, material, price, and category‚Äîmaking wardrobes trackable and searchable.
2. **Automatically generate outfit** suggestions based on clean clothes, usage history, and weather to simplify daily planning.
3. Let users **schedule outfit** usage and receive **laundry reminders** to ensure clothes are clean and ready in time.
4. **Sync data across devices** (Web, Mobile, Telegram, and Line Bot) so users can update or access wardrobe records anytime, anywhere.
5. Provide data export tools to **download usage history**, **laundry logs**, and **clothing details** in **Excel** or **PDF** format for easy reference or sharing.

## üìù Notes & Limitations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Precautions When Using the Service
- Ensure API endpoints requiring authentication are protected with proper middleware.
- Do not expose sensitive environment variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in public repositories.
- Avoid using seeded dummy data in production environments.
- Avoid using seeded dummy data with large seed at the same time.

### üß± Technical Limitations
- Telegram & Line bot polling may cause delays or downtime if the server experiences high load

### üêû Known Issues
- Limitation when using Firebase Storage for free plan Firebase Service, upgrade to Blaze Plan to use more.
